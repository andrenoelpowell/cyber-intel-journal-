# Weekly Cyber Intelligence & Defensive Design Review

**Week of:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Author:** Andre Powell  
**Focus Environment:** Enterprise | Mission / Isolated | Cloud | Hybrid

---

## 1. High-Impact Incident Selection

> Select **one primary incident** that introduces a new technique, trust failure, or large blast radius.

**Incident Name:**  
**Category:** Worm | Ransomware | Supply Chain | Identity | Edge Device | Cloud | OT  
**Why This Matters (1–2 sentences):**  

---

## 2. Incident Decomposition

**Summary (max 3 sentences):**
- **Initial Access:**  
- **Propagation / Lateral Movement:**  
- **Impact:**  

---

## 3. MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping (Spine Only)

| ATT&CK Tactic | Technique ID | Technique Name | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Initial Access | | | |
| Lateral Movement | | | |
| Impact | | | |

> Focus on the **core techniques** that enabled the incident. Avoid over-mapping.

---

## 4. Control Analysis (Prevent / Detect / Contain / Recover)

| Technique | Prevent | Detect | Contain | Recover |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

---

## 5. Derived Design Requirements

### DR-1
**The system SHALL:**  
> Clear, testable requirement.

**Rationale:**  
> Tie directly to the incident and ATT&CK technique.

**Verification Method:**  
> Configuration check, test case, tabletop, or adversary emulation.

### DR-2 (Optional)

---

## 6. Environment Gap Assessment

| Control Area | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Patch discipline | Good / Risk / Unknown | |
| Segmentation | Good / Risk / Unknown | |
| Update provenance | Good / Risk / Unknown | |
| Credential hygiene | Good / Risk / Unknown | |
| Detection speed | Good / Risk / Unknown | |

## 7. Leadership Takeaway (One Sentence)

> This week’s most important defensive lesson:  
> **__________________________________________________**

## 8. Carry-Forward Items

- [ ] Patch advisory to monitor
- [ ] Exploit or technique to watch
- [ ] Control gap to revisit
- [ ] Architecture assumption to validate
