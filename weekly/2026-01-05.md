## 1. High-Impact Incident Selection

**Incident Name:** Covenant Health data breach (Qilin ransomware claim)  
**Category:** Ransomware | Healthcare | Data Breach  

**Why This Matters (1–2 sentences):**  
A regional U.S. healthcare operator reported sensitive patient data exposure affecting **478,188 people**, with operational disruption at multiple hospitals—showing how a single intrusion can create both **patient safety/continuity** impacts and **high-cost identity risk** at scale. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 2. Incident Decomposition

**Summary (max 3 sentences):**
- **Initial Access:** Public reporting confirms a network breach occurred, but the **initial entry vector was not disclosed** in the referenced reporting. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Propagation / Lateral Movement:** Not publicly described; however, attackers maintained access to IT systems for roughly **May 18–May 26, 2025** (dwell time), implying internal access sufficient to locate and extract regulated data. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Impact:** Disruption to hospital operations (e.g., increased wait times, paper-based lab orders) and exposure of PHI/PII including SSNs, insurance, and treatment information; victims were offered credit monitoring. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 3. MITRE ATT&CK Technique Mapping (Spine Only)

> Note: Some technique selections remain **TBD** because the initial vector and exact exfiltration mechanism were **not publicly specified** in the source reporting.

| ATT&CK Tactic | Technique ID | Technique Name | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Initial Access | TBD | Not publicly disclosed | Entry vector not reported |
| Collection | TBD | Not publicly disclosed | Access to patient PII/PHI for theft |
| Exfiltration | TBD | Not publicly disclosed | Data theft of names, addresses, DOB, MRNs, SSNs, insurance, and treatment info |
| Impact | TBD | Not publicly disclosed | Operational disruption at hospitals; ransomware actor claim |

Source basis for the above: breach timeline, data types, and operational impact were reported; technical mechanics were not. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

---

## 4. Control Analysis (Prevent / Detect / Contain / Recover)

| Technique (TBD where undisclosed) | Prevent | Detect | Contain | Recover |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Initial access (TBD) | External attack surface hardening; patch/vuln mgmt; MFA for remote access; email/web protections (as applicable) | Auth + endpoint telemetry; anomalous login alerts; web/email security alerts | Rapid account disablement; isolate affected endpoints/segments | IR playbooks + restore clean access paths |
| Collection / staging (TBD) | Least privilege to PHI repositories; strong app/service account controls | Unusual database access; bulk record reads; privileged access monitoring | Segment PHI systems; restrict east-west access | Validate integrity of systems holding PHI |
| Exfiltration (TBD) | Egress filtering; allow-list outbound; DLP (where feasible) | Netflow/proxy logs; unusual outbound volume; uncommon destinations | Quarantine segments; block destinations; rotate creds/keys | Legal/regulatory response; monitoring for misuse |
| Operational impact (TBD) | Resilience engineering; segmentation between IT/clinical workflows | SIEM correlation on service outages + security alerts | Clinical downtime procedures; isolate core clinical services from general IT | Tested backups + rebuild; tabletop for “paper ops” continuity |

Operational impact and scope basis: disruptions described for specific hospitals and broad sensitive-data exposure. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

## 5. Derived Design Requirements

### DR-1
**The system SHALL:**  
Provide **segmented, least-privileged access** to patient-data systems (PHI/PII), with privileged access restricted to dedicated administrative paths and accounts.

**Rationale:**  
Attackers accessed and stole sensitive patient identifiers and treatment/insurance information at scale—indicating internal access to sensitive repositories that should be tightly segmented and monitored. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

**Verification Method:**  
Access review + network path validation; attempt “non-privileged workstation → PHI system” access in a test environment; ensure denied-by-default and logged.

---

### DR-2
**The system SHALL:**  
Maintain and exercise **clinical downtime procedures** and ensure critical workflows can operate safely under degraded IT conditions (e.g., paper order processing, limited-lab operations).

**Rationale:**  
Public reporting described increased wait times and paper-based lab orders following the incident—continuity is a control, not just an operational concern. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

**Verification Method:**  
Quarterly tabletop + annual functional exercise simulating ransomware/data-breach disruption; validate time-to-restore for critical services.

---

### DR-3 (Optional)
**The system SHALL:**  
Detect and respond to suspected breach activity within a defined window (e.g., **<24 hours**) using centralized logging and alerting for authentication anomalies and bulk data access.

**Rationale:**  
Reported access window (May 18–May 26) indicates multi-day unauthorized access; shortening time-to-detect reduces data theft and operational impact. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

**Verification Method:**  
Detection engineering test cases + purple-team scenarios; measure alert-to-triage time; document containment actions.

## 6. Environment Gap Assessment

| Control Area | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Patch discipline | Unknown | Initial entry vector not disclosed in reporting |
| Segmentation | Unknown | Recommend validating PHI segmentation boundaries |
| Update provenance | Unknown | Not indicated as supply-chain/update issue |
| Credential hygiene | Unknown | Not specified; assume credential hardening remains critical |
| Detection speed | Risk | Multi-day access window suggests need for faster detection/containment goals :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} |

---

## 7. Leadership Takeaway (One Sentence)

> This incident reinforces that healthcare risk is both **data exposure** and **service disruption**, and that segmentation + rapid detection materially reduce patient-impact blast radius. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## 8. Carry-Forward Items

- [ ] Identify top PHI/PII systems and validate least-privilege + segmentation boundaries
- [ ] Confirm centralized logging coverage for auth, endpoint, and PHI repositories
- [ ] Define and test a “dwell time” objective (e.g., detect/contain within 24 hours)
- [ ] Run a downtime tabletop that includes lab/paper-order workflows
